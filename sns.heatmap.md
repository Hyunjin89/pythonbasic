To create a heatmap using `sns.heatmap` in Seaborn, you typically need a 2D rectangular dataset, which can be represented using a Pandas DataFrame, a NumPy array, or even a list of lists. The dataset should have the following characteristics:

1. **Rectangular Shape**: The data should be organized in rows and columns, forming a 2D grid. Each row represents a different category, and each column represents a different variable or feature.

2. **Numeric Values**: The data in the cells of the grid should be numeric values. Heatmaps are most commonly used to represent numerical data, where the color intensity corresponds to the magnitude or value of the data.

3. **Complete**: The dataset should be complete, meaning that there should be values for each cell in the grid. Missing values can create issues in the visualization.

Here are some examples of valid data formats for creating a heatmap:

**Using Pandas DataFrame:**
```python
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame({
    'A': [1, 2, 3],
    'B': [4, 5, 6],
    'C': [7, 8, 9]
})
sns.heatmap(data, annot=True, cmap='YlGnBu')
```

**Using NumPy Array:**
```python
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np

data = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
])
sns.heatmap(data, annot=True, cmap='YlGnBu')
```

**Using a List of Lists:**
```python
import seaborn as sns

data = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
sns.heatmap(data, annot=True, cmap='YlGnBu')
```

In each of these examples, the data is a 2D matrix where each cell contains a numeric value. The `sns.heatmap` function can accept any of these data formats, and you can customize the heatmap's appearance using various parameters, such as `annot` for adding annotations, `cmap` for choosing the color map, and more.
